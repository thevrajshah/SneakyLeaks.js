### ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
**Live Streaming** is one of the wonders 2020 will be remembered for. I can count how many times I've heard the phrase "_Live Streaming is the **Next Thing**_" in the past few months. Moreover, everyday we're seeing people from every background join the streaming community. Be it well to do people like comedians, sports personalites, magicians, life coaches, gurus & also developers or ordinary people looking for a career, everyone is booming with the help of live streaming.

### ðŸ˜– The Problem
The reason for it being loved by people is the rawness & interactivity. People feel more connected while watching streams. **BUT**, it all comes with its own downsides. I've seen many streamers messing up live by leaking phone numbers, sensitive information or private conversations unknowingly. Afterall, the lack of control & rawness isn't always good for the streamer.

### ðŸš€ The Solution 
Hence, in order to avoid these Sneaky Leaks from messing up live streams & even entire careers at times, we have created a Machine Learning based feature which detects what you're doing and toggles the audio or video accordingly. Currently we've trained it to perform the following tasks:

- Checks whether you're whering headphones & mute your microphone accordingly. 
- Turns the video off when you're not in frame to avoid your background conversations being overheard.
- Mutes the microphone when it sees that you're on a phone call to prevent sensitive conversations from being leaked.
